# Experiment-3
Study of Tuples in python

Aim : Study of tuples in pyhton

Theory : In this experiment we learned how to use tuple in python. Tuples are immutable, i.e. they cannot be edited whereas lists can be. Tuple use () brackets while lists use [] brackets. print(tpl[1]) displays
the 2nd element of the tuple. print(tpl[1:4]) displays the 2nd, 3rd and 4th element of the tuple. tpl7+=tpl8 adds element of tpl8 to tpl7 but changes the memory location of the tuple tpl7. sorted(tuple) sorts the tuple in ascending order, but for lists we use list.sort(). tpl=(10,)*5 , printing this will print the value 10 five times. id(tpl) , printing this will display the memory location of the tuple.

LIST

Lists are mutable(can be modified).

Lists are better for performing operations, such as insertion and deletion.

Lists consume more memory.

Lists have several built-in methods.

Lists are more prone to unexpected changes and errors.

TUPLE

Tuples are immutable(cannot be modified).

Tuples are more suitable for accessing elements efficiently.

Tuples consumes less memory 

Tuples have fewer built-in methods.

Tuples, being immutable are less error prone. 

Algorithm : 

# Algorithm for Grade Evaluation

1.Start.

2.Initialize a tuple named result with three values: a string ("maths"), an integer (82), and a character ("A").

3.Unpack the tuple into three separate variables: subject, marks, and grade.

4.Display the data by printing the values of subject, marks, and grade.

5.Check the condition: If the value of marks is greater than or equal to 75:
    
6.End.

# Algorithm for Attendance Verification

Start.

1.Initialize a tuple named Attendance containing a sequence of strings: "P", "A", "P", "A", "P".

2.Count "P" occurrences: Use the .count() method to find how many times "P" appears in the tuple and print the result.

3.Count "A" occurrences: Use the .count() method to find how many times "A" appears in the tuple and print the result.

4.Evaluate Attendance: * Check if the count of "P" is greater than or equal to 1.

5.Decision Branch:

    a.If True: Print "Allowed".

    b.If False: Print "Not Allowed".
    
6.End.

Conclusion : Hence the commands on the tuples were executed successfully.
